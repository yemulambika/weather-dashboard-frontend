      <h1>Understanding Temperature and Its Impact on Weather</h1>
      <p>
        The first factor that affects Weather is{" "}
        <span className="highlight">temperature</span>. Temperature is a measure
        of the kinetic energy within the particles of an object, or how hot or
        cold an object is. An object with higher kinetic energy means the
        particles move faster, creating heat. While an object with lower kinetic
        energy means the particles move much slower and leading to colder
        temperatures.
      </p>
      <p>
        When referring to the Weather, the object described is air masses. As
        air temperature increases, the ability of an air mass to absorb water
        vapor is increased. An increase of water vapor in the air mass leads to
        an increase in the chances of rain and thunderstorms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Temperature varies with height above sea level, an increase in height
        leads to a decrease in temperature. The collision of hot and cold air
        masses can also affect the Weather due to the differences in the density
        of the air masses.
