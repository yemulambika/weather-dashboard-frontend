      <h1>Understanding Humidity</h1>
      <p>
        <span className="highlight">Humidity</span>, the amount of water vapour
        in the air, is the most variable characteristic of the atmosphere and
        constitutes a major factor in climate and weather. A brief treatment of
        humidity follows. For full treatment, see climate: Atmospheric humidity
        and precipitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Atmospheric water vapour is an important factor in weather for several
        reasons. It regulates air temperature by absorbing thermal radiation
        both from the Sun and the Earth. Moreover, the higher the vapour content
        of the atmosphere, the more latent energy is available for the
        generation of storms. In addition, water vapour is the ultimate source
        of all forms of condensation and precipitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Water vapour enters the atmosphere primarily by the evaporation of water
        from the Earth’s surface, both land and sea. The water-vapour content of
        the atmosphere varies from place to place and from time to time because
        the humidity capacity of air is determined by temperature. At 30 °C (86
        °F), for example, a volume of air can contain up to 4 percent water
        vapour. At -40 °C (-40 °F), however, it can hold no more than 0.2
        percent.
